## Inspiration  
The idea for HostelBuddy came from a real-life situation. On my friend’s birthday, I struggled to find speakers at the last minute. This made me realize the need for a platform that could help people easily borrow items from others. Together with my friends, we developed HostelBuddy – a website that enables students to lend and borrow items, making it easier to share resources and help each other.

## What it Does  
HostelBuddy is a platform that allows students to lend and borrow items like food, medicine, clothes, shoes, and more. The app is particularly useful in emergencies.  

For instance, if someone has a sudden fever or headache late at night and cannot access a medical shop, they can use HostelBuddy to quickly find available medicine from peers.  

The platform not only provides practical utility but also fosters a sense of community and sharing among students. By connecting everyone on a single platform, HostelBuddy encourages collaboration, enhances social skills, and ensures that help is just a few clicks away.
